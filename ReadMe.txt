#Final Project


For our project we choose to update an existing web page that we were interested in from a previous class. 

 When we originally pulled the code from the previous project several features were not working , such as the user login database and the signup/registration forms, and game-developer/ game listing pages .
 After figuring out that the issue was that we were missing the php code on each web page which keeps track of the current user's session we were able to get parts of the website working.
Khoa was able to figure out the issue with the registration pages and I worked on the login web pages. 

Tools that we used include VScode for our IDE , Discord for team communication, and Github for version control.

Additionally we decided to host the website using an open-source apache web server as opposed to the previous time in which it was hosted within AWS.
